			One of the most beautiful things about the complexity of our world is that, with every idea, comes new variety. With new variety comes potential for beauty, since, there is really no reason to hate anything. I think we so commonly fear things because we don't understand them, such as traditions and rules from other cultures or ways of life. This is destructive to ourselves because it can close us off to experiencing something good, and why close ourselves off to that? The key to break this is to understand things. Through understanding things, we can learn to love them because we know the reason of their existence. That said, we should try to experience every nook and cranny that the world has to offer, ever oddity can become entertaining, and every entertainment an inspiration.

Goodnight Punpun is a slice-of-life story about a cute little cartoon bird named Onodera Punpun growing up in Japan. Quickly, however, you may realize it’s about much, much more. 
<br>
<img style="width: 35%" src="punpun_issues.jpg" alt=".">
<br>
Written by Inio Asano, Goodnight Punpun is a manga series that gets very dark very quickly. In actuality, I believe the most accurate description of how to describe this manga would be “a look into the realities of how parental conflict, pornography, and modern societal issues affect the development of a child as they become an adult.” 
<br>
<img style="width: 35%" src="punpun_starry_art.jpg" alt=".">
<br>
One huge reason to read this story is the artwork alone. Asano’s visuals will leave you with a sense of beauty in the ordinary towns and a sense of unearthly serenity in the empty streets depicted. The backgrounds are nearly all photographs that are turned into graphic, black and white images, and this really helps to ground the wild, fast-paced story in reality and emphasizes how real the moments are. Almost opposing this directly is the cartoonish design of the main character Onodera and his family. They are all represented by this motif of a simple, humorous, and (dare I say) cute bird with sheets over their heads and little sticks for legs. This allows for a great deal of abstraction and exaggeration, which Asano uses to give us an array of eccentric expressions. These expressions are at times quite comical, but due to the dark themes of this story, I realize that such character abstraction almost fits better in representing dark emotions! The completely black inking and linework of the characters' negative emotions really brings out the severity of their situations and psychies, so it’s great inspiration for artists and really entertaining as a reader. These moments of abstraction and exaggeration exist in the humanoid characters as well, but on more rare occasions. This juxtaposition between the simplistic, childish design of Onodera and his family and the realistic (literally realistic since they’re made using real photographs) backgrounds that they find themselves in, I think, is one of the best usages of comics or manga as a storytelling medium. Not only did this let Asano create a story so grounded in present reality using actual photographs of the present, but he could use the flexible design of these bird characters to accentuate the themes they represent and the experiences they go through.

<br>
That all said, if you’re not in it for the art, I really encourage you to give Punpun a read to experience the societal themes the work explores. These themes are more important than ever for anyone to understand because they are things that I think almost every 20 something these days goes through in this world. As I said, one thing this comic deals with, and what you may notice upon first reading, is the way children’s lives are affected by conflict in parent’s relationships. Punpun’s parents have a problematic relationship at best, and it only gets worse as the story goes on. It really highlights some complications in our modern world, for example, how children can so commonly feel isolated and lacking in direction or motivation if left alone without consistent parent figures. A byproduct of this isolation is that these children may not have direction, since they don’t have consistent parent figures motivating them. This way, they are left feeling lost, chasing only fleeting goals, as happens to Punpun as we watch him grow from a 7 year old kid to a 22 year old adult.
