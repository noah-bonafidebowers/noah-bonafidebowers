		<h1>PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS AND DEVELOPMENTS</h1>

		<h3><i>"People tell me I think too much! ...They're probably right..."</i></h3>
		<p>
			I believe the one of the main goals of philosophy is to answer how we should live in life according to a code of morals. It asks questions like, "What should those codes be?" "On what grounds should such codes be based?" "What is the function and purpose of what we do?' "What do are we doing?" "Why am I doing this?" That last question I have to ignore thinking about less I might stop coding this site, so you can see how this can become very problematic very fast. These are the questions constantly bouncing around in my brain, which is why I can be a problematic person. Regardless, this page is to propose and <i>attempt</i> to answer those questions. I place attempt deliberately in italics since that's all I (and anyone ever) have been able to do: make humble attempts at answering simple questions like, "What is my purpose in this seemingly infinite universe?" As I've already gone on a bit of a tangent in the decription of this page, you're probably getting a sense what this page will ential (the ramblings of a madman); however, despite that, I will try my best to create cohesive, complete thoughts with definite conclusions on this page! 
			<br>
			<br>
			<i>(Even if all those conclusions, frustratingly and comfortingly, end up being to find balance between every possible solution...)</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i>... Is comfortingly a word...?</i>

		<h3>“ATTEMPT #1: HOW TO LIVE”
	</h3>
	<h6>October 9th, 2024
	<br> 1pm
	</h6>
	</div>
<div class=body>
	<p>Part of the idea of this blog site is to display how ideas, especially in such a modern, complex age, are constantly changing and evolving, day-by-day. I mean that in the sense of the world’s ideas as a whole <i>and</i> my own ideas. This is simply to try and catalog and document my ideas as they grow and change. 
<br>
<br>
That said, I titled this entry attempt 1 because, the conclusion of this entry very well may not be perfect. This highlights a central error we humans have in our ways of thinking, as well as a truth about the universe: things are not perfect. When we create conclusions, I believe they should never be considered definitive, even though that’s what we want them to be. If we take a short look throughout history, we see so many cases where we have to overwrite an old way of thinking (an old conclusion) due to a new discovery or new level of understanding. That is why I only call this attempt 1 of a guideline on how to live.
<br>
<br>
Without further ado, allow me to describe what I believe to be the way people should live. This is a universal definition, a definition to try and describe how anyone, no matter their geography, race, culture, or social and monetary standing should live. These are the things everyone should try to do. 
<br>
<br>
If I were to boil down all human goals down to one thing, and to make the simplest guideline of how to live as possible, it would be this: everyone wants to be happy. I don’t think a single person actively seeks to have a worse time or mood in life. Great! Then, how do we become happy?
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, for us humans, I believe happiness can be very simple because we are animals. We like to eat food, run around, have partners (i.e. sex or reproduction), as well as friends or other familiars to socialize with. Those are truly our basic needs. Maybe added to this could be leisure activities such as arts and having fun in other ways, but those could be expressed in passing. Today we practice these things by cultivating agriculture and going to grocery stores for food, exercising and playing sports or games, and forming and following social groups and rules such as a community and dating. This means that all people should try and participate in social groups that entice physical activity and produce food. An example of this in the present day could be having a decently paying, physical job, since jobs are a social rule we put forward that rewards us with the ability to purchase food, and a job is also a place to make social connections with potential partners and others. This is one way to live and fulfill our basic needs.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, however, being human also means there is this certain ethos to being alive that we, for some reason, have to pursue. Who knows when this arose, perhaps when we started speaking, when we started making tools, or when we started settling down into societies using agriculture, but something began to nag at us: “what is the purpose of it all?”  
<br>
<br>
This causes me to want to put fourth the idea that we don't <i>just</i> need to do those simple, animalistic things to be happy. We must push ourselves to find answers, make the most out of life, and discover truly what it means to be alive through art, science, or whatever hobby we purse-- we must be the best at it and be passionate about it. One way I have began to feel about this is an expression of our soul. Though I do not (as no one does) have an exact, universal definition for what a soul is, I do feel (so I at least know on some level) that the soul is our true self, <i>who we are</i>,and it feels great to express that. 
<br>
<br>
The question that stands: is meaning and purpose really, completely made up? If it exists so prominently in our minds, then where did it come from? This is not the only problem. We are now so engrossed in putting meaning behind things, such as the definition of love and other morals that we have to follow, that, to get our basic needs of happiness as described above, it is such a complex maze. We can no longer go back to a primitive world where happiness was simple, less be shunned by everyone else still living in the world of meaning. Not only that, if we were to retreat to this primal state, we may still hear that nagging voice: <i>“what is the meaning of it all? Is this the right thing?”</i> So maybe we must indeed strive to answer those questions...
<br>
<br>
Opposed to that, however, is the fact that, as we push ourselves and further seek "the truth", we destroy ourselves and our home, Earth, in the process. In our quest to find and secure meaning, we build monolithic structures, sacrificing hundreds of lives of slaves. We create technologies that create fireworks in one part of the world, and life-destroying firearms in another part. We create devices that aimed to bring the world towards a collective goal, but ended up making us feel more and more separated because we realize how far apart we are. We create ideas that cause harm, oppose to setting us free, like the fact that we "have to be better". We spend so much time thinking, “what is the right way to live?”, all the while forgetting to live at all. Because of our worrying that there is some greater purpose of being alive, we tend to miss out on what makes us happy– what we need.
<br>
<br>
It seems, then that there are at least two things we must follow if we are looking for a “correct” way to live. The first is to remember that we are animals, and we can derive a lot of joy by following a very basic set of needs. The second is that we are human, and we search for a higher purpose in life in pursuit of morals, and pushing the boundaries of what we are and what we can do. Will that destroy us, and what are we to do if we cannot do two things at once? 
<br>
<br>
As is often the conclusion for these trains of thought, we must come to a balance, weighing what we can do with what we cannot. Weighing what makes us happy with what makes us question being alive. The best we can do for now, is simply find balance, and maybe one day, a better conclusion will come. 
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, maybe no one else thinks these things, and it’s just me. Oh well!
