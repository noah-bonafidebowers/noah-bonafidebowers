		<h3>PURPOSE OF THIS SITE:</h3>
		<p><i>Every day a new idea is a collection of what I deem important social, conceptual, philosophical (and more) knowledge, ideas, and artwork, as well as simple developments of my own ideas. It seems that, every day, sometimes in an instant, I come up with a new idea. This is for a lot of reasons. One, I’m just neurotic; however, this world is also a very big place. Every year, every day, its complexity grows and grows exponentially. Thanks to the advent of the internet and the other ever-growing technologies that create a more globalized world, we are now all very aware of the many, many different ways of life, successes, and atrocities happening around the world. Especially where I live, in the USA, where these myriad of views and ideas coalesce and mingle constantly, every day we learn more and more how insanely complex our world is. The goal of this website, and by extent many of my developed ideas like the ones found here, is to try and find an intercept within all that through art, literature, advice, and propositions for a creation of a new culture, all under the guise that we must find balance within this complexity. That all said, welcome to Every Day a New Idea. Some thoughts will be random. Some thoughts will be more cultivated and put together. The purpose is to shed light on every idea, as, when weighed in the balance of this complex world, they all have merit. I hope to inspire you to do the same with your ideas. To write them down, develop them, test them against the real world, and talk about them with others. What use is an idea if not put out into the world to see what happens…?

			<br>
			<br>
			That all said, this page's content will be organized like this:
			<br> Different pages (as seen in the buttons below) cover different topics.
			<br> Posts will be created as they pop into my head and have the following format:
			<br>- Title
			<br>- Date
			<br>- Time
			<br>- Context 
			<br><i>Optional, describes what was happening when the thought occured</i>
			<br>- Body
			<br><i>Content of the idea. Could include my own developed writing, small ideas, links, images, et cetera.</i> 
			<br>
			<br>I hope you enjoy the site!
