		<h3>PURPOSE:</h3>
		<p><i>Every day a new idea is a collection of what I deem important social, conceptual, philosophical (and more) knowledge, ideas, and artwork, as well as simple developments of my own ideas. It seems that, every day, sometimes in an instant, I come up with a new idea. This is for a lot of reasons. One, I’m just neurotic; however, this world is also a very big place. Every year, every day, its complexity grows and grows exponentially. Thanks to the advent of the internet and the other ever-growing technologies that create a more globalized world, we are now all very aware of the many, many different ways of life, successes, and atrocities happening around the world. Especially where I live, in the USA, where these myriad of views and ideas coalesce and mingle constantly, every day we learn more and more how insanely complex our world is. The goal of this website, and by extent many of my developed ideas like the ones found here, is to try and find an intercept within all that through art, literature, advice, and propositions for a creation of a new culture, all under the guise that we must find balance within this complexity. That all said, welcome to Every Day a New Idea. Some thoughts will be random. Some thoughts will be more cultivated and put together. The purpose is to shed light on every idea, as, when weighed in the balance of this complex world, they all have merit. I hope to inspire you to do the same with your ideas. To write them down, develop them, test them against the real world, and talk about them with others. What use is an idea if not put out into the world to see what happens…?

			<br>
			That all said, this page's content will be organized like this:
			<br> Different pages (as seen in the buttons below) cover different topics.
			<br> Posts will be created as they pop into my head and have the following format:
			<br>- Date
			<br>- Time
			<br>- Context (optional) describes what was happening when the thought occured
			<br>- Body: Content of the idea. Could include my own developed writing, small ideas, links, et cetera. 
			<br>
			<br>I hope you enjoy the site!

	<h3>“ATTEMPT #1: HOW TO LIVE”
</h3>
<h6>October 9th, 2024
<br> 1pm
</h6>
</div>
<div class=body>
	<p>Part of the idea of this blog site is to display how ideas, especially in such a modern, complex age, are constantly changing and evolving, day-by-day. I mean that in the sense of the world’s ideas as a whole <i>and</i> my own ideas. This is simply to try and catalog and document my ideas as they grow and change. 
<br>
<br>
That said, I titled this entry attempt 1 because, the conclusion of this entry very well may not be perfect. This highlights a central error we humans have in our ways of thinking, as well as a truth about the universe: things are not perfect. When we create conclusions, I believe they should never be considered definitive, even though that’s what we want them to be. If we take a short look throughout history, we see so many cases where we have to overwrite an old way of thinking (an old conclusion) due to a new discovery or new level of understanding. That is why I only call this attempt 1 of a guideline on how to live.
<br>
<br>
Without further ado, allow me to describe what I believe to be the way people should live. This is a universal definition, a definition to try and describe how anyone, no matter their geography, race, culture, or social and monetary standing should live. These are the things everyone should try to do. 
<br>
<br>
If I were to boil down all human goals down to one thing, and to make the simplest guideline of how to live as possible, it would be this: everyone wants to be happy. I don’t think a single person actively seeks to have a worse time or mood in life. Great! Then, how do we become happy?
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, for us humans, I believe happiness can be very simple because we are animals. We like to eat food, run around, have partners (i.e. sex or reproduction), as well as friends or other familiars to socialize with. Those are truly our basic needs. Maybe added to this could be leisure activities such as arts and having fun in other ways, but those could be expressed in passing. Today we practice these things by cultivating agriculture and going to grocery stores for food, exercising and playing sports or games, and forming and following social groups and rules such as a community and dating. This means that all people should try and participate in social groups that entice physical activity and produce food. An example of this in the present day could be having a decently paying, physical job, since jobs are a social rule we put forward that rewards us with the ability to purchase food, and a job is also a place to make social connections with potential partners and others. This is one way to live and fulfill our basic needs.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, however, being human also means there is this certain ethos to being alive that we, for some reason, have to pursue. Who knows when this arose, perhaps when we started speaking, when we started making tools, or when we started settling down into societies using agriculture, but something began to nag at us: “what is the purpose of it all?”  
<br>
<br>
This causes me to want to put fourth the idea that we don't <i>just</i> need to do those simple, animalistic things to be happy. We must push ourselves to find answers, make the most out of life, and discover truly what it means to be alive through art, science, or whatever hobby we purse-- we must be the best at it and be passionate about it. One way I have began to feel about this is an expression of our soul. Though I do not (as no one does) have an exact, universal definition for what a soul is, I do feel (so I at least know on some level) that the soul is our true self, <i>who we are</i>,and it feels great to express that. 
<br>
<br>
The question that stands: is meaning and purpose really, completely made up? If it exists so prominently in our minds, then where did it come from? This is not the only problem. We are now so engrossed in putting meaning behind things, such as the definition of love and other morals that we have to follow, that, to get our basic needs of happiness as described above, it is such a complex maze. We can no longer go back to a primitive world where happiness was simple, less be shunned by everyone else still living in the world of meaning. Not only that, if we were to retreat to this primal state, we may still hear that nagging voice: <i>“what is the meaning of it all? Is this the right thing?”</i> So maybe we must indeed strive to answer those questions...
<br>
<br>
Opposed to that, however, is the fact that, as we push ourselves and further seek "the truth", we destroy ourselves and our home, Earth, in the process. In our quest to find and secure meaning, we build monolithic structures, sacrificing hundreds of lives of slaves. We create technologies that create fireworks in one part of the world, and life-destroying firearms in another part. We create devices that aimed to bring the world towards a collective goal, but ended up making us feel more and more separated because we realize how far apart we are. We create ideas that cause harm, oppose to setting us free, like the fact that we "have to be better". We spend so much time thinking, “what is the right way to live?”, all the while forgetting to live at all. Because of our worrying that there is some greater purpose of being alive, we tend to miss out on what makes us happy– what we need.
<br>
<br>
It seems, then that there are at least two things we must follow if we are looking for a “correct” way to live. The first is to remember that we are animals, and we can derive a lot of joy by following a very basic set of needs. The second is that we are human, and we search for a higher purpose in life in pursuit of morals, and pushing the boundaries of what we are and what we can do. Will that destroy us, and what are we to do if we cannot do two things at once? 
<br>
<br>
As is often the conclusion for these trains of thought, we must come to a balance, weighing what we can do with what we cannot. Weighing what makes us happy with what makes us question being alive. The best we can do for now, is simply find balance, and maybe one day, a better conclusion will come. 
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, maybe no one else thinks these things, and it’s just me. Oh well!
